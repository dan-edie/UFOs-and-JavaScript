# javascript-challenge

This project was our introduction to JavaScript. We were tasked with creating a table that showed data on UFO sightings
collected from all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

The base project was to simply create the table and have the code write it to the webpage. The extra project was to
allow the table to be filtered for specific data.

Things to improve:
- The logic behind the filtering is not complete. You can filter for one field, and that is it. I need to create a quick
method that updates the filter as you continue to filter down.
- I would like it if I could have more data. As is, the data set provided is very sparse. It is a great test data set,
however.

Next steps:
- Spend time to write code to better filter the table
